# What is Statistics?

- Inverse probability (mostly a defunct definition, but I really like it)
    - Consider a 6 sided die. If it's a fair die then we know that the probability of rolling a **1** is $\frac{1}{6}$
    - But what if instead I tell you that I roll a die 5 times and the results are: 1, 1, 5, 20. What's the most likely type of die that I rolled? (What's the data-generating model?)
    

- Statistics is all about learning from data to do (generally) one of two things:
    - Inference (Classical statistics, Frequentist, Likelihood-ist, Bayesian)
    - Prediction (Machine learning, AI, big data)
    - The boundaries between these concepts are not black and white

- **Statistics is about distributions**

# Inference and Prediction


- Inference: We want to draw conclusions about a population based on data
    - How do herbicides interact?
    - What factors influence crop growth?
    - Which biological theories are supported by the data?
    

- Prediction: Optimize the bias-variance trade off such that our models have high predictive ability
    - Generally don't care *why* the model works as long as it works
    - How many COVID cases will Alberta have in September?
